# Python to Kinect using NiTE2

This repository provides an interface for Kinect with Python, using OpenCV and NiTE2. It allows you to control your PC or games using body movements captured by Kinect.

## Features:
- Detects Kinect device and captures depth and skeleton data.
- Draws the body skeleton on the depth frame.
- Compatible with Kinect V1 and provides feedback on which device is being used.

## Requirements:
You will need the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `argparse`
- `opencv-python` (for `cv2`)
- `openni`

These can be installed using pip. For instance:

```bash
pip install numpy argparse opencv-python openni
```

## Setup:
1. Make sure you have the Kinect device connected to your PC.
2. Install all the necessary Python packages.
3. Run the main script to start capturing and processing data from Kinect.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Contributing:
Development/Contribution halted as of archiving this repository for now.
